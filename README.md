# furnest

A self-hosted monitor for furnished rental listings. furnest watches several listing sources, filters and scores what it finds against your criteria, posts matches to Discord with action buttons, drafts inquiry emails, and tracks every property through a review pipeline in a small web dashboard.

> **Status:** early development. Nothing runs end-to-end yet. Full docs, a configuration reference and a scraping/ToS disclaimer will be added before the first release.

## Development

Requires [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). uv installs Python 3.12 itself if you don't have it.

```sh
uv sync                       # create .venv and install dependencies
uv run furnest --help         # web | worker | migrate
uv run pytest                 # tests + coverage
uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format --check . && uv run mypy
uv run pre-commit install     # optional: run the same checks on every commit
```

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the design.
